REQUIREMENT:
-------
1. 3 wind data from satelite at 3 different time: IR1_2030.mat, IR1_2100.mat, IR1_2130.mat. Get them from "downloads"

2. Temperature and pressure data "temp3.mat"


HOW TO RUN:
-------
1. prepair

2. run    Use pre-computed data of [46,126]x[-40,40] to speed up.
or run(1) to compute all data in [46,126]x[-40,40]. It will take a lot of time.
